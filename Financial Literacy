	<li class="main"><b>Life Insurance</b>
	
		<ul>
		<li>It should really be called <strong>death</strong> insurance. If you buy a policy, it pays out after your death.</li>
		<li>Generally, you should only buy life insurance if someone else depends on your income or possibly to pay for your funeral expenses. See <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2014/02/18/3-things-you-should-know-about-life-insurance">here</a> for more information.</li>
		<li>Roughly, there are two types of life insurance: term and whole. Term is the least expensive and 99% of the time it is the best. Whole life, or any other variation (apart from term), despite being claimed as an investment, is <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/insurance/what-is-life-insurance">often one of the worst investments</a> (with a few exceptions).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
<li class="main"><b>Credit Cards
</b>
<ul>
	<li>*Use but don't abuse. We recommend a practice of <strong>only charging on a credit care amounts for which you have cash-on-hand and then pay off the full amount every month</strong> (and not carry a balance).</li>
	<li>*Avoid annual fees, high interest rates, consider other fees and seek protection against fraud. </li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
	
	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
	
<ul>
	<li>Use pre-tax dollars from paycheck to pay for as much as possible: health insurance, life insurance, flexible spending, retirement</li>
	
	<li>When borrowing, keep the rate as low as possible and the length of the loan as short as possible</li>
	
	<li>If your company (or other party) will match your contribution to a 401(k) or related destination, contribute up to at least the free match.</li>
	
	<li>When saving for needs that may occur within a short time frame, place the money in a conservative instrument (money market or short-term bond fund). When saving/investing for retirement or other long-term goals, place the money in a more aggressive instruments (mutual funds of stocks).</li>
	
	<li>When saving/investing, the longer you can have the money set aside, it will be earning at better rates. Generally, the higher the rate of return, the actual return may be greater but so will the risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action Steps for various stages in life</h3>

<ol type="A">

	<li>
		Getting a job
		<ul>
			<li>sign up for direct deposit of paycheck - convenient, safe, and some banks reward you</li>
			<li>sign up for 401(k)/403(b) plan and contribute at least up to the match given by your company - invest in STOCKs since this will be for the long haul - work on increasing yearly your contribution (perhaps the amount of your yearly raise)</li>
			<li>consider carefully which health plan to choose, if you are given a choice, factoring in your health before you sign up for a high deductible or cafeteria plan</li>
			<li>do not sign up for optional life insurance if you need to pay it yourself unless you have dependents counting on your income</li>
			<li>consider also having a portion of your paycheck going automatically to a bank account for an emergency fund</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Emergency Fund
		<ul>
			<li>start creating a fund early with the goal to have 3-6 months of net income in a savings account and/or short-term bond fund</li>

		</ul>
	</li>

	
		<li>

				</ul>
			</li>
			
		</ul>
	</li>

		</ul>
	</li>

	
	<li>
		Credit/Debit cards
		<ul>
			<li>don't use your credit card unless you have the cash to back it up</li>
